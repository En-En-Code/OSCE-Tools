# OSCE-Tools

This is a series of scripts, test suites, and other programs I've developed in order to grow, test, debug, and organize my growing collection of Open Source Chess Engines.

I started this hobby in August of 2021, and have since built a collection of over 300 working engines (and several hundred more not working), and manually going through my spreadsheet of them at this point can take a month or two. These tools should make the processs significantly less of a hassle.

Each tool is contained in its own folder, where a more detailed description of it can be found in that folder's README.

Use the Lichess API to find bot accounts with repositories to open source chess engines.
